Rollins College CMS270 Group Project Fall 2014

Problem Statement:
Your team has just been awarded a contract to design a custom coffee vending 
machine for the employees of Acme Fijet Works to use. Mr. Arnold, the owner of 
Acme Fijet, like the common software designer, eschews standard solutions. 
He wants his own custom object-oriented design. He is, however, a cheapskate.

Mr. Arnold tells us he wants a simple machine. All he wants is a machine that 
serves coffee for 35 cents, with or without sugar and creamer. That's all. He 
expects us to be able to put this little machine together quickly and for 
little cost.

Test your team's design against the following scenarios:

    •  Person puts in a quarter then selects coffee.
    •  Person puts in two quarters and then selects coffee.
    •  Person puts in quarter then pushes the coin return button.
    •  Person puts in two quarters, then walks away from machine and forgets to
       come back.
    •  Person buys two coffees, white with sugar. The sugar dispenser runs out 
	   of sugar after the first cup is produced.

Since your software will be embedded in the hardware of the coffee machine 
itself, it does not have any outputs to the user other than a cup of coffee. 
For development purposes, include a simple text display that shows messages 
from the software as a customer interacts with the machine and the machine 
produces coffee!
